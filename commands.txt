Absolutely! Here's a complete list of all the **commands used in your Suricata IDS project**, along with **clear explanations** for each step. You can save this as `commands.txt` or include it in your report.



 📜 Suricata IDS Project – All Commands with Explanations



 🔧 1. Install Suricata

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install suricata
```

* `apt update`: Updates the local package index.
* `apt install suricata`: Installs the Suricata IDS tool on Kali Linux.



 🚀 2. Start and Enable Suricata as a Service

```bash
sudo systemctl enable suricata
sudo systemctl start suricata
sudo systemctl status suricata
```

* `enable`: Ensures Suricata starts on boot.
* `start`: Launches the Suricata daemon.
* `status`: Shows if Suricata is running correctly.



 📄 3. View Suricata Alerts in Log File

```bash
sudo cat /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

* `cat`: Displays the contents of the `fast.log` file.
* This log shows real-time alerts and detections (e.g., suspicious network behavior).



 🚫 4. Block a Malicious IP Address

```bash
sudo iptables -A INPUT -s 116.119.212.207 -j DROP
```

* `iptables`: Tool to configure firewall rules.
* `-A INPUT`: Appends rule to the input chain.
* `-s IP`: Matches the source IP address.
* `-j DROP`: Silently drops the traffic from the IP.



 🔍 5. Verify `iptables` Rule Was Added

```bash
sudo iptables -L -n --line-numbers
```

* Lists all current `iptables` rules with numbers (useful for deleting specific ones).



 🧹 6. Remove an `iptables` Rule (If Needed)

```bash
sudo iptables -D INPUT <line_number>
```

* Deletes a rule from the INPUT chain by its line number (replace `<line_number>` with actual number).



 💾 7. (Optional) Make `iptables` Rules Persistent

```bash
sudo apt install iptables-persistent
sudo netfilter-persistent save
```

* Installs a service to save firewall rules so they remain after a reboot.



 🧪 8. Monitor Live Alerts (Optional)

```bash
sudo tail -f /var/log/suricata/fast.log
```

* Shows live updates from the `fast.log` file in real time.



 🧾 9. View Detailed Alerts (JSON Format)

```bash
sudo jq '.' /var/log/suricata/eve.json
```

* `jq`: A command-line JSON parser.
* `eve.json` contains more detailed info than `fast.log` (ideal for dashboards or custom analysis).



 ✅ Summary

You used these commands to:

* Install and run Suricata
* Monitor for threats
* Respond to attacks manually
* Inspect and manage logs and rules
